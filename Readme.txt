To run this program, first clone the repository to local (so that files can be saved) and mark phase1 as 'src' if
applicable. Before running the program, you need first install the required dependencies. First open the
'project structure' at the right top corner, then 'Modules' -> '+' (at the bottom), then add TWO different
dependencies separately (in the dependencies folder). After clicking 'apply', open the java file under package 'main' named 'mainEntrance.java'.
Then right click that file and choose 'Run 'mainEntrance.main()'' to run the program.

After running there would be a line showing 'user' file not found. You can ignore that since it is no data at this point.
You can now start sign up for an account (follow instructions provided on the screen, they are pretty straightforward).
There are two choices to create an account(organizer and attendant), with organizer account recommended (speakers can
only be created by organizer). There are instructions provided for each step on console, simply follow them and test all
functionalities of this program.

When you want to quit the program, please first logout from user UI. To logout first choose a task for user
controller to complete, then type 'false' when prompt "Continue for other services? Please enter true or false.
(false for log out)" is printed. After logging out, type 'N' or 'No' when following prompt is printed:
"Continue running or not? (type "(Y)es" or "(N)o")". Then the program will be terminated safely and four .txt files
would appear showing serialization is complete. Note: ctrl c (force quit) will not save data.
